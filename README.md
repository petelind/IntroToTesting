# IntroToTesting
Team, this week we have to start testing. This is the intro I'll deliver next Tuesday. We will cover why &amp; what shall we test, how Django makes our life easier, and tools and techniques demonstration. Note: you can either run pre-cooked venv inside the project, or bake your own container / venv.
